### 3. Docling

Docling is **an open-source toolkit from IBM Research that simplifies document processing for use with AI, particularly for generative AI applications**. It enables developers to easily convert various document formats, such as PDF, DOCX, and PPTX, into standardized formats like Markdown and JSON, making them readily usable by large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems.

* [Documentation](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/)

### 4. **Langflow**

Langflow is **a low-code, visual framework for building and deploying AI applications**, particularly those involving multi-agent and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. It provides a user-friendly interface, allowing developers to visually design and connect AI components without extensive coding.

* [Langflow Documentation](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow)

### 5. **Elasticsearch**

Elasticsearch is an excellent tool for implementing RAG because it offers various retrieval capabilities, such as full-text search, vector search, and hybrid search, as well as other tools like filtering, aggregations, and security features.

### 6. PostgreSQL

Postgres is **an open-source, object-relational database system**. It's known for its robust features, reliability, and ability to handle complex data workloads. Postgres supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying, making it versatile for various applications.

### 7. **Redis**

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine.

### 8. **Watson Speech to Text (STT)**

IBM Watson STT service transcribes audio to text accurately, supporting various languages and use cases.

* [**IBM Watson Speech to Text**](https://www.ibm.com/products/speech-to-text)

### 9. **Watson Text to Speech (TTS)**

IBM Watson TTS service synthesizes natural-sounding speech from text, enabling applications to speak to users.

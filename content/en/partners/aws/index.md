# Guide: Building Agentic AI Use Cases with AWS
 
## Introduction
Agentic AI refers to systems that can autonomously perform complex tasks, make decisions, and interact with users or environments in a goal-oriented manner. These systems leverage *Generative AI (GenAI)* to understand context, generate responses, and orchestrate workflows. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a robust ecosystem of tools and services to build, deploy, and scale agentic AI use cases.
 
This guide will help hackathon participants:
1. Understand AWS's GenAI approach.
2. Explore key AWS services for building agentic AI.
3. Learn how to design and implement agentic AI use cases.
4. Follow best practices for security, scalability, and cost-efficiency.

## AWS Generative AI Approach
AWS's GenAI approach is built on three pillars: **Accessibility**, **Customization**, and **Scalability**. AWS enables customers to leverage GenAI through a flexible, layered architecture that supports a wide range of use cases, from simple chatbots to complex agentic workflows.
 
### AWS GenAI Principles
1. *Choice of Models*: AWS offers access to a variety of foundation models (FMs) through **Amazon Bedrock**, including models from Anthropic, Meta AI, Mistral, and Amazon's own Titan & Nova models. This allows developers to select the best model for their use case.
2. *Customization*: Developers can fine-tune models or use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to tailor AI outputs to specific domains or datasets.
3. *Tool Integration*: AWS enables agents to interact with external tools, APIs, and data sources, making them "agentic" by allowing autonomous task execution.
4. *Security and Governance*: AWS prioritizes responsible AI with features like encryption, access control, and guardrails for safe AI outputs.
5. *Scalability*: AWS's serverless and managed services ensure agentic AI solutions can scale seamlessly to handle enterprise-grade workloads.
 
### AWS GenAI Stack
AWS organizes its GenAI services into a three-layer stack:
1. *Layer 1: Foundation Models (Amazon Bedrock)*  
   - Access to pre-trained, high-performing models for text, image, and multimodal tasks.
   - Example: Anthropic’s Claude for reasoning, Amazon Titan for text generation.
2. *Layer 2: Customization and Orchestration*  
   - Tools like Amazon Bedrock’s Knowledge Bases, Agents, and Fine-Tuning enable domain-specific customization and workflow orchestration.
3. *Layer 3: Application Development*  
   - Integrate GenAI into applications using AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon SageMaker for custom ML pipelines.

## Building Agentic AI Use Cases: Step-by-Step Guide
Here’s a practical guide for hackathon participants to build an agentic AI application using AWS. We’ll use an example use case: *A customer support AI agent* that autonomously handles inquiries, retrieves data, and escalates complex issues.
 
### Step 1: Define the Use Case
- *Objective*: Build an AI agent that answers customer queries, retrieves order details from a database, and escalates issues to a human if needed.
- *Requirements*:
  - Natural language understanding for user queries.
  - Access to a knowledge base for common FAQs.
  - Integration with a CRM system via APIs.
  - Decision-making logic to escalate complex issues.
 
### Step 2: Set Up the Tech Stack
1. *Amazon Bedrock*:  
   - Select a model (e.g., Anthropic Claude 3 for reasoning).  
   - Create a Knowledge Base in Bedrock to store FAQs (hosted in Amazon S3).  
   - Use Bedrock Agents to enable the AI to call external APIs or tools.
2. *AWS Lambda*:  
   - Write functions to query a CRM system or update a database.  
   - Trigger Lambda functions based on agent decisions.
3. *Amazon API Gateway*:  
   - Create an API to connect the agent to the CRM system.  
   - Secure the API with IAM roles or API keys.
4. *Amazon DynamoDB*:  
   - Store conversation history and user session data.
5. *AWS Step Functions*:  
   - Orchestrate the workflow (e.g., query Knowledge Base → check CRM → escalate if needed).
6. *Amazon CloudWatch*:  
   - Monitor agent performance and log interactions.
 
### Step 3: Implement the Agent
1. *Configure Amazon Bedrock*:  
   - Use the Bedrock console to select a model and create a Knowledge Base.  
   - Upload FAQs to an S3 bucket and link it to the Knowledge Base.  
   - Set up a Bedrock Agent with actions to call Lambda functions or APIs.
2. *Build the Workflow*:  
   - Use Step Functions to define the agent’s logic:  
     - Step 1: Process user input with Bedrock.  
     - Step 2: Query Knowledge Base for answers.  
     - Step 3: If no answer is found, call a Lambda function to query the CRM.  
     - Step 4: Escalate to a human (e.g., send an email via Amazon SES) if the issue is complex.
3. *Integrate APIs*:  
   - Use API Gateway to connect to the CRM system.  
   - Ensure secure communication with IAM roles.
4. *Store Session Data*:  
   - Save conversation history in DynamoDB for context-aware responses.
 
### Step 4: Test and Iterate
- Test the agent with sample queries (e.g., “Where’s my order?”).  
- Use CloudWatch logs to debug issues.  
- Iterate based on performance (e.g., fine-tune the model or adjust prompts).
 
### Step 5: Deploy and Scale
- Deploy the agent using serverless services (Lambda, API Gateway) for cost-efficiency.  
- Use Bedrock’s managed scaling to handle increased traffic.  
- Monitor costs with AWS Cost Explorer.

## Best Practices for Agentic AI on AWS
1. *Optimize for Cost*:  
   - Use serverless services (Lambda, API Gateway) to minimize costs.  
   - Monitor usage with AWS Cost Explorer to avoid overspending.
2. *Ensure Security*:  
   - Use IAM roles with least privilege principles.  
   - Encrypt data in transit and at rest (e.g., S3, DynamoDB).  
   - Implement Amazon GuardDuty to detect threats.
3. *Design for Scalability*:  
   - Leverage Bedrock’s managed scaling for AI workloads.  
   - Use DynamoDB for low-latency, scalable data storage.
4. *Prioritize Responsible AI*:  
   - Use Bedrock Guardrails to filter harmful content.  
   - Regularly audit agent outputs for bias or inaccuracies.
5. *Test Extensively*:  
   - Simulate edge cases to ensure robust agent behavior.  
   - Use CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and debugging.

## Hackathon Tips
1. *Start Small*: Focus on a single, well-defined use case to showcase agentic capabilities.  
2. *Leverage AWS Free Tier*: Use free-tier services (e.g., Lambda, S3) to minimize costs during the hackathon.  
3. *Collaborate*: Divide tasks among team members (e.g., one focuses on Bedrock, another on Lambda).  
4. *Document Your Work*: Clearly explain your tech stack and architecture in your presentation.  
5. *Showcase Impact*: Highlight how your agent solves a real-world problem.

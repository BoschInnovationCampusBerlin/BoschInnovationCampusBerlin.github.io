# NVIDIA
## Technology Stack

We will work with [NVIDIA Agent Intelligence Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/agent-intelligence-toolkit)

Agentic Workflows can provide great value and many will become reusable building blocks. Tomorrows agentic workflows are orchestrated from smaller agentic workflows. This is at the core of **NVIDIA Agent Intelligence Toolkit**. With this toolkit we lift existing agentic artefacts, be it workflows or functions to the abstraction of API endpoints. This makes it easy to reuse, test and integrate from anywhere in an enterprise.
**NVIDIA Agent Intelligence Toolkit** makes it particularly easy to orchestrate agentic AI workflows.
**NVIDIA Agent Intelligence Toolkit** is most useful, when you already have built agentic workflows with your framework of choice and you think about orchestrating them.

Prime audience are developers and practitioners who use **LangChain**, **LangGraph** and **LlamaIndex**. Practitioners who want to reuse work done by colleagues and build on the shoulder of giants.

### Your First Steps
1. You install two things locally:
   - The toolkit itself: [AIQToolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/AIQToolkit/)
   - The Chatbot user interface. Some of the example recordings make use of this interface without explicit mentioning: [AIQToolkit-UI](https://github.com/NVIDIA/AIQToolkit-UI)

2. Once you have installed this start to consume recordings like:
   - First steps with the toolkit and make basic experiments [How to Use NVIDIA AgentIQ](https://youtu.be/H65OluZaiZQ). It will make use of an LLM endpoint from [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com).
   - This video is about taking a simple LangChain based Agent and expose it through NVIDIA Agent Intelligence Toolkit: [Learn How to Build an Agentic System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3LbI28NJCs)

### Where is the LLM coming from?
We encourage the participants to get hands on with the toolkit. It can work with multiple LLM providers. In hackathon we will host a few models.

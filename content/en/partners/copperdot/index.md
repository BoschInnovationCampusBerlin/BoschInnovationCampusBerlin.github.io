Copperdot is disrupting the old, complex and slow way of sourcing PCBs that everyone is used to.
<br>
Products are now being designed more quickly, with increased functionality and a higher expectation of innovation from the consumer. PCBs are often the beating heart of these products. So their importance is unprecedented. And their supply is a priority.
<br>
Copperdot is removing the complexity, accelerating turnaround time and bringing genuine innovation to the entire process.

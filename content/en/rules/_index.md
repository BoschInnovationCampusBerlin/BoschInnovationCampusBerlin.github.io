Here you find general information about the hack itself and also some basic rules

## Preparation for the final pitch

Yes, there is a final pitch and each hack group needs to be prepared for this.
On **wednesday at 3:20 pm** is the presentation of the hacking results at the atrium.
In order to have everything prepared and together we need to have all the pitches **latest on wednesday at 11:00 am**.<br>
A hack-ninja will come to you before 11:00 am to collect the slides, pictures, videos, etc. you might have and will put it on an external storage. **Please make sure** that your PC containing the slides is USB enabled.
<br><br>
Please find [here](./Metaverse_Hackathon_Result_Presentation.pptx) a short presentation of some potential useful information of how to prepare your pitch and what to take care of. 
Within this presentation you will also find a template, which you can use for your final pitch.
<br><br>
**Please note:** You will have max. **3 min** to pitch. Time will be measured and sharp after 3 min your time is over.

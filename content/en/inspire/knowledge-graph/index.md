title: "Unstructured Data Mapping for Knowledge Graph Population"
description: "In the era of big data, organisations are inundated with vast amounts of unstructured information, particularly in formats like PDFs and documentation entries in digital systems. This unstructured data often contains valuable insights that can enhance knowledge graphs (KGs) but remains underutilised due to the challenges associated with extracting and mapping this information to existing ontologies. The proposed solution focuses on developing an AI-driven system that automates the mapping of unstructured data to a predefined ontology, facilitating the population of knowledge graphs and enabling better data integration and retrieval."

title: "Order Data Analytics Assistant"
description: "In our business, we handle a large volume of customer orders.​
For each customer order, a corresponding purchase order is placed with a supplier, and the goods are shipped via our warehouse to the customer.​
Throughout this end-to-end order process, a significant amount of data is generated — including timestamps, quantities, supplier info, delivery statuses, pricing, and more.​
This data holds valuable insights but is currently underutilized."

title: "AI Assisted Sensor and Actuator Instance Creation"
description: "â€‹In the development of control units within the HIS (Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation) environment, a library of sensors and actuators is maintained. Currently, instances of these elements are manually created based on the data sheets of the sensors and actuators. This manual process involves identifying the number of pins and other relevant attributes from the data sheets, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. Automating this process with an AI agent that can extract and pre-fill relevant attributes from the data sheets would significantly enhance efficiency and accuracy."

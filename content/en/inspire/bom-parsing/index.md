title: "PCBA BOM Parsing"
description: "In the electronics industry, there is no standardized format for Bills of Materials (BOMs) for Printed Circuit Board Assemblies (PCBAs).​
Customers typically provide BOMs in various structures and file types (e.g., Excel, CSV, PDF), often tailored to their internal processes.​
This diversity makes automated processing and digitalization of BOMs challenging."

title: "Offer Validation AI"
description: "Customers request quotations by sending us their technical and commercial requirements (e.g., PCB specifications, volumes, delivery terms).​
To create a quotation, we request offers from our suppliers based on these customer requirements.​
Currently, supplier offers must be manually reviewed to ensure they include all necessary attributes (e.g., Minimum Order Volume (MOV), lead times, pricing, delivery terms) and match the customer’s specifications."

title: "Functional document Co-Pilot"
description: "Crafting functional specifications, legal assessments, research theses, or investment plans is a complex and time-consuming endeavour that involves synthesizing vast amounts of information from diverse sources into coherent, high-quality documentation. This process is not only labour-intensive but also prone to errors, leading to potential misinterpretations and inaccuracies. Stakeholders increasingly demand not just accuracy but also innovation and strategic insights in these documents."

# Challenge
Create a prototype of an AI-based functional co-pilot that assists users in drafting a functional specification, legal assessment, research thesis, or investment plan. The prototype should demonstrate key functionalities that enhance human capabilities in documentation tasks. It must support the user to follow a recommended structure, suggest the kind of content to add and be a sparring-partner for related questions. Eventually, it reviews the documentation and suggests enhancements.

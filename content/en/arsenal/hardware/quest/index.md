Released in October 2020, the Meta Quest 2 by Meta is a popular VR headset that has sold more than the Xbox Series S/X. With a good price and modern features, it's 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the one before it. Plus, it has a faster screen update at 120 Hz, which is a big step up from the old Quest's 72 Hz.

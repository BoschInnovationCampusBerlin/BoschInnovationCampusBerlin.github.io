Released in September 2022, the Magic Leap 2, produced by Magic Leap, is a leading augmented reality headset. Designed primarily for business use, this device combines digital visuals with the user's real-world view, providing an immersive experience without disconnecting them from their surroundings. Built with the latest technology, it meets top business requirements. A notable feature is the "segmented dimming", which ensures it functions effectively even in very bright conditions.

The Microsoft HoloLens 2, released by Microsoft in November 2019, is a standalone augmented reality headset, eliminating the need for an external PC. Weighing in at 556g, it's on the heavier side but compensates with a high horizontal field of view of 43Â°. Although it has a modest refresh rate of 60 Hz, the device benefits from not requiring external base stations for operation.

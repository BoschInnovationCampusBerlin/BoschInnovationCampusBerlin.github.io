## What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI describes AI systems that go beyond pure information processing and can act, learn and adapt to complex environments independently. They perform tasks in a context-aware manner. Our definition is based on five key characteristics:

* Autonomy and goal orientation: The AI acts independently and pursues self-defined or predefined goals – without constant human control. 
* Adaptability and learning: Agentic AIs dynamically adapt their behavior to new situations and continuously improve through experience. 
* Complex problem solving: They can handle multi-level tasks, make decisions that go beyond simple rules, and develop creative solutions. 
* Contextual understanding and proactivity: Agentic AIs recognize the context of situations, anticipate problems or opportunities, and act with foresight. 
* Interaction skills: They communicate effectively – with their environment, with other systems and with people.
